- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lightman46
- 👀 Sometimes I'm a nerd but most of the time just a girl with a nice sense of humor. I'm an analyst, slowly moving to system anaysis and a bit of coding on Python. These days, it's both my work and my hobby.
- 🌱 I believe, learning is never-ending process whatever age you are.
- 💞️ I’m looking for inspiraion and ready to help with analysis, specifically business-process analysis.
- 📫 Drop me a line here or reach me via gutalevtink@gmail.com ;)
